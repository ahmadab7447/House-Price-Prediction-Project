## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various features about houses such as:

- Number of bedrooms, bathrooms
- Square footage
- Lot size
- Year built
- Location information
- Sale price (target variable)

*Note: The actual dataset source should be mentioned here, e.g., Kaggle or a custom CSV.*
